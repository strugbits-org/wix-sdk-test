## Project Setup
To set up and run the React project, follow the steps outlined below.

# Step 1: Install Dependencies
Before running the project, it is necessary to install the required dependencies. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command:

### npm i
This command will install all the necessary dependencies specified in the package.json file. Wait for the process to complete.

# Step 2: Start the React Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the React server. In the same terminal window, run the following command:

### npm start
This command initiates the development server, compiles the React application, and opens it in your default web browser. You should see the application running at http://localhost:3000 or a different port if 3000 is in use.
